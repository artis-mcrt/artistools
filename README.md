# artis-tools

A collection of plotting, analysis, and file format conversion tools for the ARTIS radiative transfer code.

ARTIS (Sim et al. 2007; Kromer & Sim 2009) is a 3D radiative transfer code for Type Ia supernovae using the Monte Carlo method with indivisible energy packets (Lucy 2002). The simulation code is not publicly available.

(This is also a bit of a test ground for GitHub integrations)
